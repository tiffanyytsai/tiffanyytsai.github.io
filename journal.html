<h1>current perspective</h1>
<p>In my discipline, the words I have been told most often are usability, functionality, and efficiency. In an accelerated world, designers have to chase after speed: further audiences in less time. As a young designer, I am also the mass public that is subjected to what design and consumer culture has created. I am not blind to advertisements that has designated me as a certain target demographic. In combination with the Digital Age, there is often a loss of human connection and meaning. More and more, hearing someone’s voice in real-time seems like too much of a commitment, too formal. The uniform text on a screen has given us never before speed and convenience, but it also feeds a culture of distance. This contempt is an issue of loneliness. It is what we have sacrificed for efficiency, and that has been a driver of my design discipline for the last few years.</p>

<p>I want to bring novelty into my work and the world. I shifted my design perspective from: “I only have three seconds to capture my audience’s attention” towards “how do I slow down time?” From here, I began to realize I have to prioritize emotional value over speed. Efficiency, in some cases, may be obsolete. In contrast, I want my design to center around connection, narration, and immersion.
In my own work, I have designed a product for creating the opposite of a looming “public or virtual space.” It makes enclosed environments where experience is tied to geo-specific locations. I have also pursued information design for qualitative data rather than quantitative. I have investigated the possibility of making charts and statistics that lend itself to human qualities, such as identity, emotion, culture, and experience. In my current workshop and thesis project, I am pursuing this idea further with cultural landscapes. I am creating a book of topographic maps that do not chart geographic elevation, but human experiences.</p>
