<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12">
<p>Meridio Solutions is work & asset management software company for North American electric utilities. They just went through a name change and required a new visual identity that would elevate them for their competition. We started with building a new logo and visual identity system, which was then applied to a tradeshow booth and website. As their inhouse UI/UX designer, I had already been in charge of their app user interfaces and experience, but I took on the responsibility of modernizing and streamlining their corporate identity for this project.</p><br/>

<h6>Process + Construction</h6>
After the name was selected by the company, I presented several rounds of logos and concepts. This artboard is basically where the magic happens, and from this, an actual logo is distilled. We wanted an monogram logo for better visual to oral name recognition, as most of the Sales are done via remote phone calls.<br/><br/>

<h6>Building the Brand</h6>
<blockquote>A logo doesn't sell, it identifies. A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important than what it looks like.<br/>
— Paul Rand</blockquote><br/>
After several rounds of approval with clients, we settled on a brand identity which I applied across the board on the most important consumer facing collatoral ( including upcoming tradeshow booth designs ) to showcase how the visual identity would be applied. I streamlined their existing product logos to fit, as well as created some new ones. <br/>

<h6>Website</h6>
<p>The client had a lot of new messaging and content that needed to be laid out and presented differently. I built a custom WordPress theme according to the brand identity with 4 unique templates to cover around 2 dozen pages.

<h6>Tradeshow Design</h6>
<p>The client launched their brand at a large utility tradeshow in Nashville. I designed the booth and its layout along with the marketing department at Meridio.
